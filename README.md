# Casino Test App

## Notes

- Jackpot prices refreshes every 10 seconds
- Ribbon design is just CSS
- Using plain CSS and simple react project (using a framework might be overkill)
- Created animation when hovering (doesn't do anything)
- Navbar are based on the games categories. Thus, Table, Live, and Jackpots are empty.
